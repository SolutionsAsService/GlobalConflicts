        "Summary": "The Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 was a pivotal conflict in the Caucasus region. It involved Georgia and the Russian-backed separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The war began with Georgia's attempt to regain control over South Ossetia and quickly escalated as Russia intervened militarily. The conflict resulted in a Russian, South Ossetian, and Abkhaz victory, leading to significant territorial losses for Georgia, large-scale displacement of civilians, and heightened tensions between Russia and the West."
