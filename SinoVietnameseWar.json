        "Summary": "The Sino-Vietnamese War was a brief but intense military conflict between China and Vietnam, primarily along their shared border. It occurred from 17 February to 16 March 1979. The war's roots lay in Vietnam's relationship with the Soviet Union and its occupation of Cambodia, which threatened China's regional influence. China launched a punitive expedition into Vietnamese territory, aiming to force Vietnam to abandon its invasion of Cambodia. The war ended with both sides claiming victory. Chinese forces occupied parts of Vietnam temporarily before withdrawing, and Vietnam continued its occupation of Cambodia until 1989. The war exacerbated tensions between China and the Soviet Union and led to Vietnamese expulsions of overseas Chinese."
