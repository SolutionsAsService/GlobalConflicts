  "summary": "The First Ivorian Civil War was a conflict in Ivory Coast from 19 September 2002 to 4 March 2007 between the government of Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo and the New Forces rebel group led by Guillaume Soro. The war, marked by foreign interventions and significant casualties and displacements, was driven by ethnic tensions, exclusionary policies, and political disputes following years of instability and coups. The conflict ended with a peace agreement but was followed by renewed conflict due to unresolved political tensions."
