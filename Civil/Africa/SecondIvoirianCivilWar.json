  "summary": "The Second Ivorian Civil War erupted following a disputed presidential election, pitting incumbent Laurent Gbagbo against internationally recognized winner Alassane Ouattara. The conflict saw the involvement of the Ivory Coast military, Liberian mercenaries, UN forces, and French troops. It culminated in the capture of Gbagbo and the victory of Ouattara's forces, but not before causing significant casualties and widespread human rights abuses, particularly in Duékoué. The war significantly impacted Ivory Coast's political landscape and its relations with the international community."
