        "Summary": "The Tajik Civil War was a multifaceted conflict in Tajikistan from 1992 to 1997, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The war was primarily between the government and the United Tajik Opposition, which included a variety of groups with differing ideologies, ranging from Islamic factions to liberal democratic elements. The conflict was marked by a complex interplay of political, ethnic, and religious tensions, with significant involvement from neighboring countries and international organizations. The war resulted in a military stalemate, leading to a peace agreement and power-sharing arrangements."
