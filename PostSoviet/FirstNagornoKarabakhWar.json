        "Summary": "The First Nagorno-Karabakh War was a territorial and ethnic conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. It began amid the weakening of Soviet power and escalated into full-scale warfare. The war resulted in Armenian forces gaining control over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azerbaijani territories, leading to significant displacement and casualties on both sides. The conflict ended with a ceasefire in 1994, leaving Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding areas in a state of unresolved, de facto independence."
