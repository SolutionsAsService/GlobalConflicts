        "Summary": "The First Chechen War was a major conflict in the North Caucasus region of Russia, marking a violent struggle for independence by the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria from the Russian Federation. The war began after a failed attempt by Russian forces to regain control over the region, leading to widespread destruction and significant civilian casualties. Despite superior military strength, Russian forces faced fierce resistance from Chechen fighters. The conflict ended with the Khasavyurt Accord, leading to Chechnya's de facto independence until the outbreak of the Second Chechen War."
