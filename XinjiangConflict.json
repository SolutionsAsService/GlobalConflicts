        "Summary": "The Xinjiang conflict involves a series of violent clashes, including terrorist attacks, that have occurred in the Xinjiang region of China. The conflict began in the early 20th century and has persisted to the present day. It has involved various belligerents, including Chinese government forces and various Uyghur and East Turkestan independence movements. The conflict has been marked by periods of heightened violence, such as terrorist attacks from 1990 to 2006, and a second wave of violence between 2007 and 2016. Since 2016, there has been a reduction in terrorist attacks, but concerns over human rights issues, including the establishment of internment camps in Xinjiang, have increased."
