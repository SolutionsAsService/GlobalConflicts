        "Summary": "The Angolan Civil War was a prolonged conflict in Angola that began immediately after the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It involved various factions and significant foreign intervention, with the MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA as key players. The war was marked by foreign military support, particularly from Cuba, the Soviet Union, and the United States, among others. It ended with an MPLA victory after the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in 2002."
