      "Summary": "The Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923) was a series of military campaigns and a revolution led by the Turkish National Movement. It occurred after parts of the Ottoman Empire were occupied and partitioned following its defeat in World War I. The conflict pitted Turkish Nationalists against Allied and separatist forces, with a focus on applying Wilsonian principles, including national self-determination, in Anatolia and Eastern Thrace. The outcome of this revolution was the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the abolition of the Ottoman monarchy and the Islamic caliphate, and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey. This marked a transfer of sovereignty from the sultan-caliph to the nation and set the stage for a period of nationalist reform in Republican Turkey. The war was triggered by the occupation of Anatolia by the Allies and the establishment of a nationalist government led by Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) in Ankara, which opposed the Ottoman government's appeasement of the Allied powers and their unfavorable Treaty of Sèvres.",
